I keep copying and pasting functions into a python session. Is there a better way to accomplish that?

What is the difference between sqlite file extension and db file extension? Flask uses sqlite and the sqlite documentation uses db.

next projects:
    pagination
    a link to each car page
    another view for the data manipulation
